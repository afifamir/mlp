# Predicting Student Marks

In this repository, you'll find a comprehensive implementation of regression models from scratch, organized with a modular approach to simplify understanding and customization.

## Features:
### Folder Structure:
The repository is organized into two main folders:

* Notebook: Contains Jupyter notebooks for demonstration and experimentation.
* src: Houses the core components and pipeline for the regression process.

### Component Breakdown:
The src directory is further segmented into specific components:

#### Data Processing:
* Data Ingestion (data_ingestion.py): Handles the loading and preprocessing of datasets.
* Data Transformation (data_transformation.py): Incorporates various transformations such as imputation and encoding.

#### Machine Learning Modules (model_trainer.py):
* Linear Regression: Implementation of the linear regression algorithm.
* K Nearest Neighbors Regression: Utilizes the KNN algorithm for regression.
* Decision Tree Regression: Implements regression using decision trees.
* XGBoost Regression: Incorporates the powerful XGBoost algorithm for regression tasks.

## Data Transformation Details:
Techniques Used:
* Imputer Strategies: Offers different strategies for handling missing data.
* Encoder (One-Hot Encoder): Facilitates categorical variable transformation into numerical format.

## Requirements:
To run the code, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-Learn
  
Feel free to explore the notebooks for practical demonstrations and examples of utilizing these regression models. Dive into the src folder to understand the core components driving the regression process and modify them according to your needs.

Enhance your understanding of regression algorithms by experimenting with various models and their configurations. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, contributions are welcome!
